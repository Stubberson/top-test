        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>My version of this classic Thai dish has spectacular taste even with regular basil instead of Thai or holy basil. The sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat.
            The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>⅓ cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped</li>
                <li>¼ cup sliced shallots</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
                <li>2 cups hot cooked rice</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.</li>
                <li>Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.</li>
            </ol>
