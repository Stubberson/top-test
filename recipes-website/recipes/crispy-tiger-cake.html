            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
                <li>1 (11 ounce) package white chocolate chips</li>
                <li>½ cup butterscotch chips</li>
                <li>¾ cup crispy rice cereal (such as Rice Krispies)</li>
                <li>½ cup peanut butter</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper or aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Place semisweet chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until melted, about 1 minute. Stir chocolate until smooth.</li>
                <li>Combine white chocolate chips and butterscotch chips in a separate microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave for 1 1/2 minutes. Stir mixture until smooth. <br>
                    If chips aren't completely melted, continue heating in the microwave in 10-second intervals, stirring after each interval until smooth.</li>
                <li>Stir crispy rice cereal and peanut butter into white chocolate-butterscotch mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Spoon semisweet chocolate in lines across the peanut butter mixture. <br>
                    Run a knife in the opposite direction of the chocolate lines to achieve a swirled, tiger-stripe pattern. <br>
                    Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 10 minutes. Cut into small squares.</li>
            </ol>
